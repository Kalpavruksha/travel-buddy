# Video Background Implementation

This document explains how the video background feature was implemented on the Travel Buddy Bot homepage.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Video Background Component

The video background is implemented using the HTML5 `<video>` element with the following attributes:
- `autoPlay`: Automatically starts playing when the page loads
- `loop`: Continuously loops the video
- `muted`: Mutes the video to comply with autoplay policies
- `playsInline`: Ensures the video plays inline on mobile devices

### 2. CSS Styling

The video is styled with CSS to cover the entire hero section:
- `position: absolute`: Positions the video absolutely within its container
- `top: 0; left: 0`: Anchors the video to the top-left corner
- `width: 100%; height: 100%`: Makes the video fill its container
- `object-fit: cover`: Ensures the video covers the area while maintaining aspect ratio
- `z-index: -1`: Places the video behind other content

### 3. Gradient Overlay

A CSS gradient overlay is applied to ensure text readability:
- Linear gradient from blue to indigo with 75-85% opacity
- This darkens the video background to make white text stand out

### 4. Fallback Support

For browsers that don't support the video element:
- A static background image is defined in the CSS
- The video element includes fallback text: "Your browser does not support the video tag."

## File Structure

```
/app
  ├── page.tsx              # Main homepage with video background
  ├── home-video.css        # CSS for video background styling
  ├── video-test/           # Test page for video background
  │   ├── page.tsx          # Video background test implementation
  │   └── video-test.css    # CSS for test page
  └── globals.css           # Global styles (updated to remove conflicting background)
```

## Video Source

The video used is from Mixkit:
- URL: https://assets.mixkit.co/videos/preview/mixkit-ancient-ruins-and-stone-columns-4483-large.mp4
- License: Free for commercial use with no attribution required

## Customization

To change the video:
1. Replace the `src` attribute in the `<source>` tag with a new video URL
2. Update the fallback background image in `home-video.css` if needed

To adjust the overlay:
1. Modify the gradient colors in the `.hero-video-bg` class in `home-video.css`
2. Adjust opacity values to change the darkness level

## Performance Considerations

- The video is muted to comply with autoplay policies and reduce bandwidth
- The video is optimized for web use (MP4 format, compressed)
- The video is only loaded on the homepage to minimize impact on other pages

## Browser Support

The implementation works on all modern browsers that support:
- HTML5 video element
- CSS3 object-fit property
- Flexbox layout

For older browsers, the static background image fallback ensures the page still looks good.
