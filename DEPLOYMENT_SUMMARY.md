# Vercel Deployment Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to convert the Express backend APIs to Next.js API routes for deployment on Vercel.

## Changes Made

### 1. Converted Express Routes to Next.js API Routes

#### Chat API (`app/api/chat/route.ts`)
- Converted from `backend/routes/chat.js`
- Maintains the same functionality for processing chat messages
- Uses Google Generative AI (Gemini) for responses
- Includes fallback response handling

#### Forts API (`app/api/forts/route.ts`)
- Converted from `backend/routes/forts.js`
- Supports multiple actions:
  - `all`: Get all forts
  - `map`: Get forts for map display
  - `featured`: Get featured forts
  - `stats`: Get statistics
  - `difficulty`: Get forts by difficulty level
  - `search`: Search forts by query
  - `id`: Get specific fort by ID
- POST endpoint for recommendations

#### Data API (`app/api/data/route.ts`)
- Converted from `backend/routes/data.js`
- Supports multiple data types:
  - `categories`: Get category data
  - `tips`: Get travel tips
  - `difficulty-levels`: Get trek difficulty levels
  - `seasons`: Get seasonal information
  - `fort-types`: Get fort types
  - `history`: Get historical periods

### 2. Updated Database Service

#### `backend/services/databaseService.js`
- Modified to read data from JSON files instead of hardcoded data
- Added proper error handling for missing fields
- Implemented all previously unimplemented methods:
  - `getFortsByDifficulty`
  - `getFeaturedForts`
  - `getRecommendations`
  - `getStatistics`

### 3. Updated Fort Model

#### `backend/models/Fort.js`
- Added new fields from JSON data structure:
  - `images`
  - `description`
  - `tags`
  - `rating`
  - `reviews`
  - `ropewayFee`
  - `accommodation`
- Updated `toJSON`, `getBasicInfo`, and `getDetailedInfo` methods to include new fields

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Single Deployment**: Both frontend and backend can be deployed together on Vercel
2. **Simplified Architecture**: No need to manage separate Express server
3. **Better Performance**: Next.js API routes are optimized for Vercel deployment
4. **Consistent Environment**: Both frontend and backend use the same runtime environment

## Testing

All API routes have been tested and verified to work correctly:
- Database service functions properly
- All fort data is accessible
- Search functionality works
- Map data is formatted correctly
- Statistics are calculated accurately

## Next Steps

1. Verify environment variables are properly configured in Vercel
2. Test the deployed application
3. Monitor for any issues after deployment

## Environment Variables Needed

- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Google Generative AI API key
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API key (optional)
