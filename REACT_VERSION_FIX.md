# React Version Conflict Fix

## Issue
Your Vercel deployment is failing due to a React version conflict:
- Your project is trying to use React 19.1.0
- react-leaflet 4.2.1 requires React ^18.0.0
- This causes npm to fail during the install phase

## Current Status
Your package.json already has the correct React version (18.3.1), but Vercel might still be using cached dependencies.

## Solution

### Option 1: Clean Local Installation (Recommended)
Run the clean installation script to remove cached dependencies:

**On Windows:**
```cmd
clean-install.bat
```

**On Mac/Linux:**
```bash
chmod +x clean-install.sh
./clean-install.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Clean Installation
If you prefer to do it manually:

```bash
# Remove node_modules and package-lock.json
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

# Reinstall dependencies
npm install
```

### Option 3: Force Reinstall with Legacy Peer Dependencies
If the above doesn't work, you can force npm to accept the peer dependency mismatch:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

## After Cleaning

1. Commit the changes:
```bash
git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "fix: ensure React 18.3.1 for react-leaflet compatibility"
git push origin main
```

2. Redeploy on Vercel

## Verification
After deployment, check that:
- The map functionality works correctly
- The chatbot responds properly
- All interactive elements function as expected

## Why React 18.3.1?
React 18.3.1 is the latest stable version that is fully compatible with all current dependencies in your project, including react-leaflet. While React 19 has some exciting new features, the ecosystem support isn't complete yet, which is causing the deployment issues.
