# React Version Options for Travel Buddy

## Current Status
Your project is currently configured with React 19.1.0, which is causing peer dependency warnings with react-leaflet.

## Option 1: Stay on React 19 (Current package.json)
- Keeps all the latest React 19 features
- May have compatibility issues with some libraries
- Uses the "overrides" field to force npm to accept the version mismatch

## Option 2: Downgrade to React 18 (package-react-18.json)
- Fully compatible with all current dependencies
- No peer dependency warnings
- Proven stable version

## How to Switch

### To use React 18 (Recommended if build fails):
1. Replace your current package.json with package-react-18.json
2. Run `npm install` to update dependencies
3. Commit and push to Vercel

### To stay on React 19:
1. Keep the current package.json with the overrides section
2. The warnings will appear but the build should still work
3. Commit and push to Vercel

## Recommendation
If your current build fails due to React compatibility issues, switch to React 18 by:
```bash
# Backup current package.json
cp package.json package-react-19.json

# Use React 18 version
cp package-react-18.json package.json

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

Then commit and push to Vercel.
