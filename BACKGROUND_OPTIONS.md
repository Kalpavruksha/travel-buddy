## Performance Comparison

| Feature              | Video Background | Lightweight Version |
|----------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Initial Load Time    | 2-5 seconds      | < 1 second          |
| Data Usage           | ~5MB             | < 50KB              |
| Memory Usage         | High             | Low                 |
| Battery Impact       | High             | Low                 |
| Mobile Performance   | Moderate         | Excellent           |
| Offline Support      | No               | Yes                 |

## Automatic Selection Logic

The application automatically selects the best background based on:

1. **User Preference**: Saved in localStorage
2. **Device Type**: Mobile devices default to lightweight
3. **Screen Size**: Screens < 768px default to lightweight
4. **Network Conditions**: (Future enhancement)

## Customization

### Changing Video Source
1. Update the `<source>` tag in `/app/page.tsx`
2. Ensure the video is optimized for web (MP4, H.264 codec)
3. Update fallback background image if needed

### Modifying Gradient Colors
1. Update the gradient classes in `/app/light-home/page.tsx`
2. Modify the `@keyframes gradientMove` in `/app/globals.css`

### Updating Lottie Animation
1. Download new JSON from LottieFiles
2. Replace `/app/animations/travel.json`
3. Adjust size/positioning in component if needed

## Accessibility

Both versions include:
- Proper contrast ratios for text
- Reduced motion support
- Semantic HTML structure
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility

## Future Enhancements

1. **Network-based selection**: Automatically switch based on connection speed
2. **User preference survey**: Ask users for their preference
3. **Time-based themes**: Different backgrounds for day/night
4. **Seasonal variations**: Holiday-themed backgrounds
5. **Personalization**: User-selected background options
